			<p><strong>The Primacy of the How:</strong>a design framework that puts the value delivery at the center of the value proposition<br><br>Alexander Manu <i>Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch</i> Routledge, 2017.</p>	
			</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>The most important concept I have been thinking about lately is <i>The Primacy of the How</i> from Alexander Manu's <i>Transforming Organizations</i>. The Primacy of the How suggests that the <i>how</i> has usurped the <i>what</i> at the center of the value proposition. This is to say that how value is delivered is more important than the creation of value itself. This assertion is predicated on the fact that the <i>what</i> of behaviour platforms today usually corresponds to a number of latent human behaviours. We use Facebook because we are social, networked beings, we send Snapchats <i>because we can</i> and we use Uber because we need to get from point a to point b.<br><br>The Primacy of the How as an exercise involves asking the question: what is the question that X is the answer to? For example: what is the question that Uber is the answer to? A: How do I get from point a to point b without having to drive myself? How do I summon a form of transportation in the most seamless manner possible? How do I monetize my vehicle in my free time? These questions are answered by a platform that gets people where they are going quickly and seamlessly, being driven by another individual who has a car in the moment that you don't. If the designers of Uber had simply asked <i>what</i> (i.e. what is a problem we can solve?), they would have designed a bicycle. Instead they asked <i>how</i>, the same way the founders of Airbnb did, and invented an entirely sharing new economy based on value delivery.  
				<br><br>
				The Primacy of the How is also an incredibly powerful framework for idea generation. Think deeply about what users want and evaluate how they are getting it. My wifi is provided by Bell through fiberoptic cables but Elon Musk's Starlink seems like a better way. I ordered my first big grocery delivery the other day due to lockdown restrictions and was amazed by the speed of the service. My girlfriend's aunt just discovered DoorDash and was amazed by how quickly it satisfied her craving for Baskin and Robbin's ice cream. That's what the primacy of the how is all about.</p>
